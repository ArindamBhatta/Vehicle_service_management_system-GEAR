# Vehicle Service Management System (GEAR)

A comprehensive vehicle management system for vehicle owners, collectors, and restoration shops. This app provides tools to manage vehicles, track restoration progress, and communicate with service providers.

## Key Features

- Vehicle management and tracking
- Restoration project tracking
- Service provider communication
- Document storage and management
- Maintenance records
- User authentication with Supabase
- VIN and license plate management
- Responsive web interface
- And more...

### Architectural Rules (ENFORCED)

- **Repository Pattern**: ALL data access MUST go through Repository interfaces
- **No Direct Database Access**: UI layers CANNOT call Supabase directly
- **RPC First**: Prefer Supabase RPC functions over client-side SQL queries
- **Immutable Models**: All models MUST be immutable with `copyWith()` methods
- **Async Boundaries**: Use `Future<Either<Failure, T>>` for ALL async operations

## Conclusion

The GEAR system aims to revolutionize vehicle service management by leveraging modern technologies. It empowers both customers and service centers with real-time information, transparency, and efficiency. Whether you're a vehicle owner or a service provider, GEAR simplifies the vehicle servicing process for everyone involved.
